YADL
	"Yet Another markDown Languague"
		"YAML in Markdown, but better!"
		"JSON without curly brackets!"
	"Yet Another Dumb Language!"
		-	some random person on the Interwebz

Changes compared to YAML
	Tabs instead of Spaces!
		Indentations are done with Tabs
		Data is organized in TSV [tab-seperated values] tables
	data can be called indirectly
	YADL to YAML compiltation is easily possible
		Tabs will be replaced with spaces, because YAML using spaces is just cringe and I'll refuse to do that bullshit!

Changes compared to Markdown
	Line Breaks just work, no double spaces at the end.
		Empty lines are easy to do.
		Paragraphs are seperated by double empty lines.
	Added HTML5 elements
		Easy compilation to HTML5
	Embedding of files

File Format
	UTF-8
		Other Encodings need to be specified with <encoding> at the <header> of the document.
	.yadl file extension
		Was not used as of the day of writing
		Systems that only support 8+3 characters in filenames are all end-of-life and should not be used in any productive way.
		.yaml is used by YAML
	LF Line endings
		OSes that use CRLF are inherently trash or EoL anyways.
	Date & Time Format
		Dates and Times are exclusively stored in only two acceptable forms:
			1640991364 (UNIX Timestamp)
			YYYYMMDD,hhmmss:TZ - i.e. 20211231,235604:CET
				Dates can also be presented as YYYYMMDD,-
				Time can also be presented as -,HHMMSS
				Unless the Timezone has been specified, it'll be interpreted as Unixtime - human readable [UTC without leap seconds]
